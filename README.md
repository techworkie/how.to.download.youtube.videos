YouTube has billions of videos available for streaming, but sometimes, you might want to download some of them for offline viewing. 

However, there's no download button that allows you to save them onto your computer. This is odd, considering that the YouTube mobile app allows you to download videos on your smartphone and watch them offline.


**Here are the two ways to download YouTube videos on your computer.**

##How to download YouTube videos using VLC Media player 

VLC Media Player is a free app that lets you watch videos or play music from your Mac or PC. There's a chance you might already have it installed on your computer.

And although it'll take a few minutes, you can use it to download any YouTube video.

1. Find the video you want to download off YouTube and copy its URL.

2. Open VLC. If you're on a PC, click Media in the top menu, and then Open Network Stream. If you're on a Mac, click File in the top menu, and then Open Network.

3. In the pop-up that appears, select the Network tab and paste the YouTube video's URL in the text box at top, and then click Play or Open at the bottom.

4. After a moment, the YouTube video will begin playing. A longer YouTube video will take longer to open.

5. If you're on a PC, click Tools in the top menu, and then Media Information. If you're on a Mac, click Window in the top menu, and then Media Information.

6. In the Media Information" pop-up, there will be a Location text box at the bottom. Double-click the URL in this text box to select it, and then copy it.


7. Go back to your web browser and paste that link into the URL text box at the top of the screen, and then hit the Enter key on a PC or Return key on a Mac.

8. You'll be brought to a page with just the video playing. Click on the three vertical dots in the bottom right corner, and then click Download.

The video will download onto your computer as an .MP4 file. You can name it or move it wherever you like.


## How to download YouTube videos using the WinX or MacX YouTube Downloader
WinX and MacX are a whole suite of programs, each of which is made for downloading videos from different sources. The WinX and MacX YouTube Downloaders, as the names suggest, are meant for downloading YouTube videos.
